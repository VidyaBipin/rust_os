# Core Features/Drivers #
- Networking
 - Requires a design for both kernel API and user API
 - Interacts with permissions (inetd-type system for servers?)
  - Maybe just have a service like the FS?
 - Client sockets unrestricted? (so that a web browser isn't spammy)
- USB Support
 - Requires API design for kernel API
 - Possibly expose a user-side API? (for arbitary drivers)

# Logging and Messages #
- Kernel log rendered to its "window"
 - Downside: Kernel log is verbose, this will slow down most operations (on render)
 - Having an aliased buffer containing the messages would be better (render in thread)
- Kernel panic messages rendered to display
  - Mostly done.
- User panic messages rendered to a kernel-owned window
 - This same infrastructure can be used for blocked windows/processes

# Syscalls #
Named object handles (or just named VFS roots?)

# Userland
- AcessNative-esque test suite?

# Filesystem #
- Strict file/object permissions via handle permissions
 - Pass a set of directory handles to new processes, indicating what they can access
  - Extend object passing to use names for the passed handles
 - Disallow write to anything via absolute paths
 - MAYBE disallow absolute paths?
 - A process can request a handle via a service (which presents the file/folder-open dialog)
 - Standard set of paths: "Root", "AppRoot", "AppData"
- Remodel VFS to have split roots
 - Things like sysroot with retargeted handles

# GUI tweaks #
- Tag group handle with the application name (for server-side identification)

# GUI Apps #
- Text editor
 - Simple text edit control
 - With scrollbars
 - Menu bar

# Async IO #
- Unified kernel API
- User can have two, one pure async, one standard sync
