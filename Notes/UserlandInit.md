Initial userland program (basically a lightweight init) is loaded from a custom binary format


# Init Format
- 16-byte header
 - Magic number (32-bits)
 - Entrypoint (32-bit even on 64-bit platforms, magic includes target arch).
  > This also defines the load address, as the entrypoint must be in the first 4KB of the binary)
 - Code size (i.e. how many bytes need to be RO+X)
 - Reserve size (i.e. how large this image is in-memory, will be padded with writable zeroes)


# Init Program
The Tifflin userland starts with an executable loader with the above header (TODO: Edit that block to fit the actual format used).
The header allows the kernel to easily load the initial loader, without needing to include an ELF loader.

This loader then uses part of the kernel command line to load the real 'init' process off the disk and truly start the system.

The loader binary acts as the system's dynamic linker, and wraps process execution for the user



# Initial program state by kernel
_(Reference: `Kernel/Core/main.rs`, `Kernel/Modules/syscalls/objects.rs`)_
- Loader in memory, passed path to init binary
- Stack set to region specified by the loader
- On first object lookup by PID0, the syscall layer opens:
 - _No real speed issue, as PID0 spends most of its time idle_
 - A kernel logging stream handle
 - A read-write UID0/GID0 handle to the filesystem root
